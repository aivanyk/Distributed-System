# CS651 Code

## Preliminary Requirements

1. Create an account on Gitlab: Signup using your BU email

2. Fork the repository: We will be using the CS651 Code repo to maintain code for assignments. Fork it and make sure to select cs651-fall24Â in the namespaces dropdown and set the visibility level to Private.

3. Submitting assignments: All assignments must be submitted to Gradescope (see @9 on how to enroll). We will share detailed instructions on how to submit once the assignment is released. Final submissions must also be pushed to your private Gitlab repository before the assignment deadline. We will be using the Gitlab commit timestamp to confirm that you pushed on time.

Please push regularly to Gitlab and always use meaningful commit messages to help us track progress.
